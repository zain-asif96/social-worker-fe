              the Service and be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, do
              not register as a User. KIFFGO reserves the right to amend the
              Agreement at any time. In the event that a change is significant,
              we will display a notice on the KIFFGO website or send you an
              email. The change will be effective as of its notification to the
              User. The User enters into this agreement regarding the use of the
              KIFFGO services with KIFFGO, a company registered in England and
              Wales with company registration number 10910102, whose registered
              office is at TheCastle House, Castle Street, Guildford, United
              Kingdom, GU1 3UW (“KIFFGO”). KIFFGO is a matching making service
              and not a delivery transport solution. We aim to provide a
              pier-to-pier sharing platform where you (“The Customer, The
              Sender”) and businesses which provide transport services (“Service
              Provider”) can find each other. Senders cannot send any items that
              would be illegal to be transported in any country. For greater
              certainty the following items must not be transported between
              Senders and Service Provider including but not limited to:
              firearms or components of firearms, weapons, corrosive or
              hazardous substances, drugs and tools capable of being used as
              weapons and explosives. In addition KIFFGO has the right to object
              to any item that may be transported using the Service, if KIFFGO
              is aware of what is to be transported and has reasonable grounds
              for objecting. If you have concerns over what items may be
              transported using the Service, please contact us at
              <a href="hello@kiffgo.io"> hello@kiffgo.io</a>. If the Service
              Provider’s activity is commercial then it must adhere to all laws
              governing transport of goods, including and not limited to having
              the required insurance, licenses and/or permits.

              By entering into this Agreement, the User obtains access to the
              Service as it is offered from time to time. KIFFGO is free to add,
              remove or change features or functionality of the Service. KIFFGO

              3.2 CORE FEATURES OF THE SERVICE
            </h2>
            <p className={`mb-3 ${css(AppStyles.pera18)}`}>
              KIFFGO matches Senders and Service Provider on the move to utilize
              available transport capacity. The Service matches Senders with a
              need to have something transported with Service provider willing
              to do the transportation. The Service provides the ability to
              match these two parties. After matching, Users finalise
              transportation arrangements directly. KIFFGO provides Usage Rules
              which contains recommended terms and conditions between the Sender
              and the Service provider. Users enter into a direct agreement with
              each other and KIFFGO is not a contractual party to such agreement
              entered into between Users. KIFFGO merely supplies the medium for
              Users to connect with each other. While KIFFGO requests
              information to identify registered Users, the Service is dependent
              on the Users providing correct information. Consequently, KIFFGO
              does not take any responsibility for the actions or omissions of
              any Users connecting via the Service and neither does KIFFGO
              assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of User
              information or any other information on the Service.

            <p className={`mb-3 ${css(AppStyles.pera18)}`}>
              When you register as a User, we might need the following

              The information is used to establish contact between Users, manage
              the Agreement and to take reasonable measures to verify the
              identity of Users. In addition, you may need to provide further
              information in connection with each individual transaction which
              allows the Sender to determine the means of transport, etc.

              Although we use techniques that aim to verify the accuracy and
              truth of the information provided by our users, user verification

              will take every possible precaution to safeguard the wellbeing of
              animals during transport and that it has the expertise and ability
              to carry out such a delivery.

              an additional fee for the van entering and using the centre's
              facilities, as you will be responsible for this charge.

              Customers are able to travel in the van with the driver. Spare
              seats are based on your van size selection and the number of
              helpers you have requested. The number of seats available will be
              confirmed in App or Website prior to booking. You are not charged
              extra to travel in the van and this service is offered as a
              courtesy by the Service Provider. For this reason, no refund will
              be made for complaints in relation to the Service Provider's
              driving ability, nor the manner of his driving. In addition, if a
              Service Provider feels that a customer has been in any way rude or
              abusive to him, he is not compelled to carry that passenger in his
              van. In no way does travelling in the van constitute a private
              hire and the cab of the van does not constitute a public area.
              Therefore please be aware that no smoking rules do not apply.

              If a dispute arises between you and KIFFGO, we encourage you to
              first contact us directly to seek to resolve the matter by
              contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@kiffgo.io"></a>
              support@kiffgo.io. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve
              the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures,
              such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.
              This Agreement between you and KIFFGO shall be governed by and
              construed in accordance with the laws of England.

              You and KIFFGO both agree to submit to the non-exclusive
              jurisdiction of the English Courts. The use of the phrase
              “non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts” means that if
              you were able to bring a claim arising from or in connection with
              this Agreement against us in Court, an acceptable court would be a
              court located in England, but you may also elect to bring a claim
              in the court of another country instead. However in whatever Court
              you bring a claim, English law will apply.
